The conceptual aspects of the code provided for managing student details in C++:

1.Classes and Objects:
The code uses the concept of classes and objects in C++. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class. In this case, the Student class serves as a blueprint for creating student objects with specific attributes and behaviors.

2.Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class). In the Student class, data such as the student's name, roll number, marks, grade, and attendance are encapsulated within the class.

3.Constructor:
The constructor Student(string name, int rollNumber) is a special member function of the Student class that initializes a new student object when it is created. It takes parameters such as the student's name and roll number and initializes the corresponding member variables of the object.

4.Member Functions:
Member functions are functions defined within a class that can operate on the class's data members. In the Student class, there are several member functions:

i>addMarks(int mark): Adds a mark for a subject to the student's record.<br>

ii>calculateGrade(): Calculates the grade based on the student's marks.<br>

iii>updateAttendance(int daysPresent): Updates the student's attendance by adding the number of days present.<br>

iv>displayDetails(): Displays the student's details such as name, roll number, grade, and attendance.<br>

5.Data Abstraction:
Data abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details of a class and exposing only the essential features to the outside world. In this code, the details of how grades are calculated or attendance is managed are abstracted within the Student class. Users interact with the class through its public interface (member functions) without needing to know the internal workings.

6.Data Encapsulation:
Data encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data within a class. It helps in controlling access to the class's data, allowing for better data security and integrity. In the Student class, the member variables (name, rollNumber, marks, grade, attendance) are private, meaning they can only be accessed or modified by member functions of the class.

7.Information Hiding:
Information hiding is closely related to data encapsulation and refers to the principle of hiding the internal details of how data is represented or manipulated within a class. It prevents direct access to the class's private data members from outside the class, ensuring that data is accessed and modified through controlled interfaces (member functions).
